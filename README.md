# Nature of Code

Personal repo containing my code while working through "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman. Not an official companion to the book.

## How to Run

From [https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server):

> If you are using Python 3, type:
>
> ```
> python -m http.server
> ```
>
> Then visit `http://localhost:8000` on your browser.
>
>Unfortunately the python simple server is very slow. Loading a local page will often stall and it can't stream video and has trouble with even medium size files like an 8MB mp3 for example. However, it should suffice for loading in most text files, fonts and most images.
